//Add the names of your Drive motors into the motor groups below, separated by commas, i.e. motor_group(Motor1,Motor2,Motor3).
//You will input whatever motor names you chose when you configured your robot using the sidebar configurer, they don't have to be "Motor1" and "Motor2".

//Left Motors:
motor_group(L1,L2,L3,L4),

//Right Motors:
motor_group(R1,R2,R3,R4),

//Specify the PORT NUMBER of your inertial sensor, in PORT format (i.e. "PORT1", not simply "1"):
PORT4,

//Input your wheel diameter. (4" omnis are actually closer to 4.125"):
2.5,

//External ratio, must be in decimal, in the format of input teeth/output teeth.
//If your motor has an 84-tooth gear and your wheel has a 60-tooth gear, this value will be 1.4.
//If the motor drives the wheel directly, this value is 1:
1,

//Gyro scale, this is what your gyro reads when you spin the robot 360 degrees.
//For most cases 360 will do fine here, but this scale factor can be very helpful when precision is necessary.
